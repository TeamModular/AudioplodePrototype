notes on compiling fliudsynth

cmake
mingw64 also on path
pkg-config win64 added to path

GLib from GTK
GTK+ 	2.22.1

to fix pkg-config
cd C:/MinGW/bin
cp libintl-8.dll intl.dll
from http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/mingw_how_to.html
above didn't work, but putting taht dll into path did make more progress

so: downloaded http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/
stuck in the path, removed old pkg-config

this gets pkg-config working.  No idea how to get pkg-config to acknowledge that glib and gthread exist
