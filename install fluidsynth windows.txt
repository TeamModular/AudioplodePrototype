notes on compiling fliudsynth

cmake
mingw64 also on path
pkg-config win64 added to path

GLib from GTK
GTK+ 	2.22.1

to fix pkg-config
cd C:/MinGW/bin
cp libintl-8.dll intl.dll
from http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/mingw_how_to.html
above didn't work, but putting taht dll into path did make more progress

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/spatialite-users/pyKmshYwRlc/PPiJZkDAy54J


so: downloaded http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/
stuck in the path, removed old pkg-config

this gets pkg-config working.  No idea how to get pkg-config to acknowledge that glib and gthread exist

need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH for semicolon seperated list of folders with the .pc files for hte libraries pkg-config needs to find


navigate to folder where binaries were set
call c:\mingw64\bin\mingw32-make

trying renaming libintl-8.dll back to libintl.dll - dind't work

copied lib and include from proxy-libintl-dev_20090911_win64 (also from GTK website) into C:\mingw64  now compiles!!!



althoguh it compiles it doesn't run
http://www.opencsw.org/package/libintl8/
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/dependencies/gettext-runtime_0.18.1.1-2_win64.zip
took dll from ^ and put over top of (I prsume 32bit) versino that was with mingw32 in system32
